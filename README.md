# SpeakEasy
This is the codebase for SpeakEasy!

It's a speech practice app.

It records your voice input like any other recording software, but outputs your speech into words on the screen so you can visually see how you are speaking.

It also includes "word highlighting" which marks words like "uhm, like, and I" so you can better prepare for your speech.
